<h2 align="left"> COVID-19 GAMEATHON </h2> </br>
FEBRUARY 12- MARCH 12
<li>In an attempt to fight the virus, this hackathon is being hosted to encourage and develop innovative games that address issues faced by people during the pandemic. Organized by St. Francis College for Women and HEART Hyderabad through a grant from the U.S. Consulate General Hyderabad. Hosted by Angelhack. </li>
</br>
WHAT IT’S ALL ABOUT
<li>The aim of this Gameathon is to raise awareness about the challenges caused by the pandemic whilst offering solutions that might help people stay safe.<li>

<h2 align="left"> The Problem Statement </h2>  
In an attempt to fight the virus, this hackathon calls upon developers to create innovative games that address issues faced by people during the pandemic. We are supposed to design a game that will help bring about awareness about the on going pandemic.


<h2 align="left"> Solution </h2>  
Our main objective it to promote social distancing and also to dismiss any misconceptions that people have developed over the new vaccine which has developed by India. We have analysed a few papers and have found that many people are not willing to take the vaccine. Through our game we want to promote the use of sanitizers , social distancing and preach the importance of vaccination.


<h2 align="left"> INTRODUCTION TO GAME </h2>  

<li>The main character has to avoid all the obstacles present in each level and has to jump on the floating islands  avoiding  the monsters and the viruses. Here the monster represent the more virulent and  deadly  covid strain and the virus the less virulent strain by doing so we have stressed on the different strains which have been found we could not add a few features due to the lack of time however in future we can incorporate all the possible strains .</li>
<li>We have also incorporated vaccine as a weapon as vaccination is the only way we can free our society of this pandemic. We have also kept the gameplay experience easy to understand so that even a kid who is only 5 years old can easily play corona convicts.</li>
<li>The main character has to collect vaccine and inject it to the monster to destroy it and in this process he also has to avoid the virus . If he comes in contact with the virus it would cause him to lose life in the game. If he collects vaccine he would gain life . In this game the user is provided with 5 lives and if he exhausts all of them he will lose the game. He has to collect the vaccine and avoid virus keeping at least one life intact in order to win.</li>

<h2 align="left"> Tech Stack </h2>  

Purpose | Tool
------- | -------
Character and Enemy Movement | Construct 3 platform movements
Character Animation  | Construct 3 character animation sets
Shield effect |  Construct 3 particle affect with custom effect 
Trap Movement | Construct 3 sine and rotation behaviour


<h2 align="left"> Game Design </h2>  
<li>The player is equipped with a sanitizer gun which is used to shoot the virus particles.<br></li>
<li>If the player comes in contact with a particle, it will respawn. <br></li>
<li>Going too close to the particle  reduces players health. <br></li>
<li>Shooting other players with sanitizer results in the increase of health but approaching another player results in the violation of social distance. <br></li>
<li>Masks are present and collecting them increases health of the player. <br></li>
<li>The Reinforced Learned COVID particles have a win/lose reward state which makes the floor red in the player infected state and green if the player successfully evades the particles. <br></li>
<li>As a survivalistic aspect, only the other players can view your player’s health and vice versa that enables them to help each other to fend off against the onslaught of COVID virus cells. <br></li>
